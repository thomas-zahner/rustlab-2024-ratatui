## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (make sure you have the latest stable version installed).

2. A code editor with [`rust-analyzer`](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) plugin (or anything at your preference).

3. A performant terminal with image rendering support (is good to have). We recommend [`wezterm`](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/).

### Setup

Simply start by cloning this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/orhun/rustlab2024-ratatui-workshop
```

Your job is to implement a terminal client for a chat application using Ratatui!

[Click here to start the workshop](./workshop/00_intro.md)! ➡️

Start reading through the chapters and sometimes you will be asked to implement some parts of the application. Don't worry, the solutions are also provided! :)
